# Java-HTTP-Server
This repository contains the final project for the "CIS 400: Web Server Design" course at Syracuse University. The contributors to this project are Sam Hagan and Malcolm Navarro. The project involved designing a Java HTTP Web Server that can handle standard GET/HEAD/POST requests. SSL was added as an additional feature.
